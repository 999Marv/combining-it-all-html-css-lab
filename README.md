# Unit 1 Lab: Combining it All

## Purpose

Over the past several lessons of this unit, you've learned so much about HTML and CSS. In today's lesson, you'll bring everything you learned together to build a portfolio template. Some of the tools you'll need to use:

  + Flexbox
  + Responsive design
  + Forms
  + Grid/Responsive

## Directions

1. Use the wireframes linked here to build a portfolio template. The wireframes will give you an idea of how things should be laid out, but you should feel free to play around with colors and other styles.
2. The wireframes include three pages:
  * A main landing page, with a header, and a Navbar
  * An "About" page with an image gallery
  * A "Contact" page with a contact form
3. Each page includes designs for both desktop and mobile. Your site should be responsive and automatically adjust based on the size of the device. (Use 768px as the breakpoint size).
